This is a demo to demonstrate this bug:
```
^[[999D  console.error node_modules/vuetify/dist/vuetify.js:25038                                                                                
    [Vuetify] Multiple instances of Vue detected                                                                                                 
    See https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify/issues/4068                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                 
    If you're seeing "$attrs is readonly", it's caused by this 
```
## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

```
